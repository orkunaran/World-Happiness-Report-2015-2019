## About

The  **World Happiness Report**, published by the Earth Institute and co-edited by the instituteâ€™s director, Jeffrey Sachs, reflects a new worldwide demand for more attention to happiness and absence of misery as criteria for government policy. It reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.  It contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors.

The report being published since 2012 to our day, giving insights about the happiness ranks of different countries around the world. The data has five csv's which includes different years' happiness rankings. 

Data is collected from people in over 150 countries. Each variable measured reveals a populated-weighted average score on a scale running from 0 to 10 that is tracked over time and compared against other countries. These variables currently include:

- Real GDP per capita
- Social support
- Healthy life expectancy
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of corruption

In this notebook, we tried to answer;

- What makes people in a county happy?

- In which countries the happiness scores changed remarkably? 

- In total, from 2015 to 2019, how did the variables change?

Dataset is taken from kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness).
